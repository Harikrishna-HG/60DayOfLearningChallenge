# Day 1: JavaScript Practice

Welcome to Day 1 of my 60 Days of Learning Challenge! Today, I explored some fundamental JavaScript functions and how they interact with HTML elements. Here’s a quick overview of what this mini-project covers:

## What’s Included

- **Change Paragraph Text:**  
    Click a button to update the text inside a paragraph.

- **Change HTML Content:**  
    Replace a paragraph’s content with bold text using `innerHTML`.

- **Write to Document:**  
    Use `document.write()` to display a message directly on the page.

- **Show Alert:**  
    Trigger a browser alert with a simple message.

- **Log to Console:**  
    Print a message to the browser’s console for debugging.

- **Print Page:**  
    Open the print dialog to print the current page.

## How to Try It Out

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Click the various buttons to see each JavaScript function in action.

## Project Files

- `index.html` – The main HTML file with buttons and paragraphs.
- `script.js` – All the JavaScript functions live here.
- `style.css` – (Optional) Add your own styles to make it look better.

Feel free to play around with the code and experiment!
